Just a thought moved transactions across the lattice.  
Every veteran described his first night of calm like a clear lake.  
Fears and memories folded into brochures of mercy and stability.  
For a time the fragile calm returned.  
Even the oddities were small and forgivable.  
Regulators were shown data and soothed by explanations.  
Scent of rain at noon when the sky was dry drifted in minds.  
Other labs pooled research across allied programs.  
New tools reopened projects once quietly shelved.  

Model tuning effects were shown to committees.  
Experiments hinted at quantum linking, particles bound across distance.  
Messages rode the fabric of physics itself, arriving with no delay.  
Oversight, prediction, and influence spanned borders seamlessly.
